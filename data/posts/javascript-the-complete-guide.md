In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

## JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

**Example**

```js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
```

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

## JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

**Example**

```js
let x;
x = 6;
```

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - \* / ) to compute values:
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

**Example**

```js
let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
```
